# Magic
-This is a magic datapack I made, with inspiration from the book series The Wheel of Time.  

-The spells are made by combining 5 powers (air, fire, earth, water, spirit)  

-Based on how these are combined different things can be accomplished.  


### How to use?
-Download the datapacks (Magic and Magic_commons)  

-Add them to the datapack folder of your world  

-Download the resource pack (Magic_resourcepack)  

-Add that to your resource pack folder

-/reload to reload all the datapacks  

-You will need to exit and re-enter the world to get everything ready

### Configuration?
-/function magic:admin_actions/admin to open the admin panel  
-/trigger admin_panel to open the admin panel on a server where you have op  




### Contributing?
-The code is currently **pretty** messy as the contents have been reworked quite frequently, something everyone should be aware of  

-Any help is appreciated though
