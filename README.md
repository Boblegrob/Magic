# Magic
-This datapack is called "Magic" and is my imagination of how the very detailed magic system in The Wheel of Time works  
-The Wheel of Time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time), is a book series writen by Robert Jordan before his untimely death  
-Considering the complexity and vagueness of Jordan's system it is worth remembering that this is my interpretation


### Adding the magic pack to your world
-This datapack is really a combination of 4 different datapacks  
-Unless you want to mess with half broken datapacks I suggest not using either "Magic_help" or "Magic_pve"  
-"Magic_commons" is necessary for the function of the main datapack, "Magic", thus these two should be downloaded and dragged into the datapack folder in you world  
-The resourcepack is also important unless you want a horrible user experience, it should be placed in your "./minecraft/resourcepacks/"  
-**/reload** should enable the datapacks, if this does not work you might need to **/datapack enable "file/Magic"**, then **/datapack enable "file/Magic_commons**  
-A relog might also be needed to get the new dimension working correctly  
  
**For optimal user experience:**
1. Command blocks needs to be enabled (they are often disabled on servers) (enable with enable-command-block=true in server.properties)
2. Function permission level needs to be 4 (function-permission-level:4 in server.properties) (this is not possible on singleplayer)
  
**Configuration:**  
-If you aren't playing on a server you will initially need to use **/function magic:admin_actions/admin**  
-On a server where you have op, or after using the command above **/trigger admin_panel** should be sufficient for future configuration  

### Actually using the datapack
-Hopefully you have some kind of idea from the books :)  
-You can open the power by looking straight forward while crouching, then straight up while still crouching  
-You can exit the power by dropping your "Force"  
-Weaves are made by combining the five powers (either dropping or clicking), then activated by clicking with the weave  
-Spells require held power to create, the held power is shown with the number on the screen and can be increased by using "Force" and then deselecting the "Force"
