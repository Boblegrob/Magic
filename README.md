# Magic
-This is a magic datapack I made, with inspiration from the book series The Wheel of Time.
-The spells are made by combining 5 powers (air, fire, earth, water, spirit)
-Based on how these are combined different things can be accomplished.

### How to use?
-Dowload the datapack
-Add it to the datapack folder of your would
-/reload to reload all the datapacks
-/trigger magic_admin to open the admin panel

/trigger set_halve_hold 500 set the hold strenght to **500** which is high, this is obviously adjustable
/trigger set_regenerated 10000 set the regeneration strenght to **10000** which is high, this is obviously adjustable

/trigger select_player set 1 **That is the id of the player which will be able to use magic** ids are visible in the tab menue

Click the "Add ability" checkmark in the panel visible by once again typing /trigger magic_admin

Finally "Give cheat book" can be clicked to give the player 2 guide books


### Contributing?
-The code is currently **very** messy as the contents have been reworked quite frequently, something everyone should be aware of
-Any help is appreciated though
